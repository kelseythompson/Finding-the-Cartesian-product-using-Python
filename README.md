# Finding-the-Cartesian-product-using-Python
This code defines a function cartesian_product that takes two lists, A and B, and computes their Cartesian product. The Cartesian product of two sets (or lists, in this case) A and B is the set of all possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.
