# Finding-the-Cartesian-product-using-Python
This code defines a function cartesian_product that takes two lists, A and B, and computes their Cartesian product. The Cartesian product of two sets (or lists, in this case) A and B is the set of all possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.

# Cartesian Product Calculator

This repository contains a simple Python script to compute the Cartesian product of two lists. The Cartesian product is a common operation in set theory and is used in various fields, such as database management, combinatorics, and mathematics.

## Introduction
The Cartesian product of two sets (or lists) `A` and `B` is the set of all possible ordered pairs `(a, b)` where `a` is an element of `A` and `b` is an element of `B`. This project contains a Python function that calculates the Cartesian product of two input lists.

## Requirements
To run this script, you need:
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cartesian-product-calculator.git
